# Space Invaders project
For my final project I will replicate the game "Space Invaders" using aschiimatics. 

The game consists of a small ship placed on the lower end of the screen controlled by the user facing upwards. 
The user can control the ship and move it left and right. The user can also make the ship shoot beams upward. 

On the higher end of the screen there is a float of enemy ships, facing towards the user's ship. The enemy float will
shoot beams just like the ship controlled by the user. The user's ship can only 3 attacks from the enemy. After the
user's ship has been impacted 3 times, it is game over. The enemy float also moves towards the user's ship, if the float
reaches the user's ship, it is game over as well. 
Each of the enemy ships in the float do not resist any attacks, so if the user succesfully lands an attack, the enemy ship
is automatically destroyed. Once all of the enemy's ships are destroyed, the user wins. 
A score will also be displayed.
